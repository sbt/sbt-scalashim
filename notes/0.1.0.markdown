This is the initial release of sbt-scalashim.

Usage
-----

Add the following to your `build.sbt`:

    scalaShimSettings

    sourceGenerators in Compile <+= scalaShim

When you reload the settings and compile, this generates the following only if `scalaVersion` is prior to 2.9:

    object sys {
      def error(message: String): Nothing = throw new RuntimeException(message)

      def exit(): Nothing = exit(0)
      
      def exit(status: Int): Nothing = {
        java.lang.System.exit(status)
        throw new Throwable()
      }
    }

See [readme][1] for more info.
